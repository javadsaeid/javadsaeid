ðŸ‘‹ Hey there! Iâ€™m a Full-Stack Developer whoâ€™s diving into the world of Java and making the exciting switch to the Java ecosystem. My background is in PHP, Symfony, JavaScript, React, and MySQL, but now Iâ€™m expanding my skills with Spring Boot and all things Java.

ðŸ’¡ I love building useful web apps, solving problems, and learning new tools and technologies. Switching stacks has been a big step, and Iâ€™m excited about where this journey will take me!

ðŸŒŸ Always up for collaboration and connecting with like-minded developersâ€”letâ€™s create something awesome together!
